        After you create a project you will have to create a “Client ID” and 
        fill in some project details for the consent form that will be presented to the client.
        Under “APIs & auth” go to “Credentials” and create a new Client ID. Probably you will want 
        a “Web application” Client ID. Provide your domain name or test domain name in “Authorized JavaScript origins: https://localhost”. 
        Finally fill in http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/google/login/callback/ in the “Authorized redirect URI”

        url: https://localhost
        callback: http://localhost/accounts/google/login/callback/
